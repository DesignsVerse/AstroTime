    title: "Shri Ram Kundali",

    details: {
      birthDate: "10th January, 5114 BCE",
      birthTime: "Noon (12:00 PM)",
      birthPlace: "Ayodhya, India",
      zodiacSign: "Cancer (Karka)",
      nakshatra: "Punarvasu (4th Pada)",
      guna: "Sattvic (Pure)",
      ascendant: "Leo (Simha)",
      strengths: [
        "Ideal king and ruler (Maryada Purushottam)",
        "Embodiment of dharma and righteousness",
        "Compassionate yet decisive leader",
        "Master strategist and warrior",
        "Perfect balance of strength and compassion"
      ],
      weaknesses: [
        "Sometimes too rigid in following principles",
        "Took harsh decisions for dharma (like abandoning Sita)",
        "Overly trusting nature"
      ],
      personality: "Lord Ram represents the perfect man - virtuous, courageous, and devoted to truth. His chart shows strong leadership qualities with a deep sense of responsibility. The planetary positions indicate a divine purpose with Jupiter's strong influence granting wisdom and Saturn's position showing ability to endure hardships. The Moon in Punarvasu suggests a nurturing nature with strong intuition.",
      additionalAnalysis: "Ram's chart shows a rare combination of Raja Yoga (for kingship) and Dharma Yoga (for righteousness). The positioning of Sun and Moon indicates a life of duty and sacrifice. The strong Jupiter gives spiritual wisdom while Mars provides warrior capabilities. This is the chart of a divine incarnation with perfect balance of all qualities."

  ravan: {
    title: "Ravan Kundali",
    image: "/ravan/ravan-kundali.png",
    details: {
      birthDate: "Unknown (Treta Yuga)",
      birthTime: "Midnight (12:00 AM)",
      birthPlace: "Lanka",
      zodiacSign: "Scorpio (Vrishchika)",
      nakshatra: "Jyestha (3rd Pada)",
      guna: "Tamasic (Dark)",
      ascendant: "Scorpio (Vrishchika)",
      strengths: [
        "Brilliant scholar (Master of Vedas and Shastras)",
        "Unparalleled mastery of arts and sciences",
        "Powerful ruler with military genius",
        "Fierce warrior with boons from Shiva",
        "Deep knowledge of occult sciences"
      ],
      weaknesses: [
        "Excessive pride and ego (led to downfall)",
        "Uncontrolled desires and lust",
        "Disrespect for women (ultimate weakness)",
        "Inability to control anger",
        "Misuse of divine knowledge"
      ],
      personality: "Ravan's chart shows immense intelligence and power but corrupted by ego and lust. His planetary positions indicate knowledge but lack of wisdom in application. The combination of Mars and Ketu gives fierce warrior capabilities while Rahu's influence shows unconventional thinking. However, the affliction of Moon shows emotional instability and uncontrolled desires.",
      additionalAnalysis: "Ravan's chart is a classic example of wasted potential. The strong Mercury indicates unmatched intellect while Jupiter's position shows mastery of scriptures. However, the conjunction of Mars and Rahu shows destructive tendencies. The chart has multiple powerful yogas but they're all corrupted by the influence of Tamasic planets. This shows how even the greatest gifts can lead to downfall when used without wisdom."
